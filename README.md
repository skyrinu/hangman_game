# hangman_game
I created this Hangman game to put my understanding of lists, loops -
for and while, conditional statements, modules, functions into practice.

# How does this game work?
This game asks user to guess a word and give them 6 lives. With each 
wrong guess for letter of the word, 1 life is taken away from the user.
If user could not guess the all the letters of the word within 6 lives,
they lose. With each life taken away, a hangman figure starts to 
appear. With 6 lives taken away, a hanged person's image is appeared.
